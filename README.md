### My language history(it is very bad cuz i changed them too frequently😢)

* I started on trying coding with Python😘 back in 2018-2019 (thank to my father), made some projects like visualization of exel file in Charts
but then i dropped it.
* I then started learning C++👍 by courses (ended on half of course)
* I started learning C#🤔 when i were going to robotics (rasberryPi, Arduino), I throw it either.
* I tried JavaScript
* Then I started learn C++👍 again but it didnt least long.
* Then I started learn Scala🌹.
It was okay but I then took a big brake of it and forgor😢 almost everything and threw it away
* I didnt least on one more than a year (exept Python🥰 I think)

Now as I started learning Rust in 2023 I am full of motivation and wont throw it away. **I WONT THREWIT I SWEAR**😡
I'll stay on Rust, I like syntax of Rust lang and have some projects on my mind!🥱
